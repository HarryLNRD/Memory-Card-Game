# Memory-Card-Game
This is a Simulation of a Card Memory Game where you match the pairs of cards.
The images used for the cards are from GrandTheftAuto 5 and they belong to Rockstar. 
This game was created using Visual Studio Enterprise 2015

Git hub wouldn't let me upload it all together so i had to upload it bit by bit.

After downloading the files from the repository to a file of your desire move everything except MemoryDen.sln into the MemoryDen folder 

Once you're done the exe file should be in /MemoryDen/bin/Debug/MemoryDen.exe
